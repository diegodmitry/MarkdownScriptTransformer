# Markdown Processing Script

## Overview

This TypeScript script automates the processing of a markdown. It's designed to enhance efficiency by automating specific text manipulations, including:

- Omitting the first two lines of the document.
- Identifying and handling lines starting with "**" as comments, while removing leading and trailing "**".
- Extracting and formatting the first and last values from lines based on the "|" delimiter.
- Generating a shell script `output_backend.sh` with the processed content.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js must be installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of TypeScript and Node.js environment.

## Setup and Execution

1. **Environment Setup**: Ensure Node.js is installed on your machine. For TypeScript files, make sure you have TypeScript installed globally or your project is set up to compile TypeScript to JavaScript.

2. **File Placement**: The markdown file should be named `backend.md` and placed in the parent directory of the script. Adjust the `inputFilePath` in the script if your file is located elsewhere.

3. **Running the Script**: Use the following command to run the script if you're using `ts-node` (for direct execution of TypeScript files):

    ```bash
    ts-node path_to_your_script.ts
    ```

    If compiled to JavaScript, use:

    ```bash
    node path_to_your_compiled_script.js
    ```

4. **Output Verification**: Upon successful execution, check the script's directory for the `output_backend.sh` file. This file will contain the processed outputs as per the script's logic.

## Features

- **Selective Processing**: The script intelligently skips unnecessary lines and extracts relevant information, making it suitable for preprocessing markdown files for further processing.
- **Markdown Compatibility**: Designed with markdown syntax in mind, ensuring lines marked with emphasis are appropriately handled as comments in the output file.

## Customization

This script is customizable to fit various needs. To tailor the script to different scenarios, consider modifying:

- Input and output file paths to align with your project's directory structure.
- The processing logic to match specific patterns or data extraction requirements in your markdown files.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

- Check the markdown file's format and location.
- Ensure Node.js is correctly installed and set up to run TypeScript files.
- Confirm that the script's file paths are correctly configured for your environment.
